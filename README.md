# Automatic-traffic-signal-detection
Automatic traffic-signal detection using neural network  

  The ultimate goal here is to identify the situation and make a decision accordingly. This is enabled with the help of various sensors, input devices and machine learning techniques such as convolution neural network, support vector machines. 
  We have used convolution neural network image classification technique to train our car to identify various signal and react accordingly.
 CNN is basically machine learning technique which consists of neural that has learnable weights.
 It will identify various signs such as start, stop etc. and according to car will move.
